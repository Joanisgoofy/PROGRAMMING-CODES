<br>I have watched you from afar and longed to be cuddled up next to you, feel your arms around me keeping me safe and secure. You're the only one I need! I long to hear your voice call me and praise me for my good doings and love me for me.

I promise to stand by you and be as loyal to you as you are to me. Endless love is what I crave and a home to call my own. To feel love and appreciation, knowing I will be yours forever is all I ask. We will share so many fond memories and make our own adventures together paw in hand.
